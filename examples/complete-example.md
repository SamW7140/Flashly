## What is a cell?

The basic structural and functional unit of all living organisms. A cell is the smallest unit that can carry out all the processes of life.

Key characteristics:
- Enclosed by a membrane
- Contains genetic material (DNA)
- Can reproduce

## What is the cell membrane?

<!-- This is a detailed answer with multiple paragraphs -->

The cell membrane (also called plasma membrane) is a biological membrane that separates the interior of the cell from the outside environment.

**Functions:**
- Protection and support
- Regulates passage of substances
- Cell communication

**Structure:**
- Phospholipid bilayer
- Embedded proteins
- Cholesterol molecules

## What are the main types of cells?

1. **Prokaryotic cells** - No nucleus (bacteria)
2. **Eukaryotic cells** - Have nucleus (animals, plants, fungi)

## Notes Section (Not a Flashcard)

This header is excluded from flashcard parsing because of the skip comment above.

You can use this for personal notes, reminders, or organizational content.

## What is the function of mitochondria?

Mitochondria are the {powerhouse} of the cell, responsible for producing {ATP} through cellular respiration.

Structure:
- Double membrane
- Inner membrane folded into cristae
- Contains own DNA (mtDNA)

## Quick Facts (Inline Format)

Number of cells in human body::~37 trillion
Size of typical cell::10-100 micrometers
Discovery of cells::Robert Hooke, 1665

## What is photosynthesis?

The process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy (glucose) using chlorophyll.

**Equation:**
6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

## What is cellular respiration?

The metabolic process that breaks down glucose to produce ATP.

**Types:**
1. Aerobic respiration (with oxygen)
2. Anaerobic respiration (without oxygen)

## What is osmosis?

The movement of {water} molecules across a {selectively permeable membrane} from an area of lower solute concentration to higher solute concentration.

## What is the nucleus?



## More Cloze Examples

The {cytoplasm} is the gel-like substance inside the cell.

{Ribosomes} are responsible for {protein synthesis}.

The {endoplasmic reticulum} (ER) comes in two forms: {rough ER} and {smooth ER}.

## Expected Results

**Total flashcards created:** 13

**Breakdown:**
- 8 from headers (H2)
- 3 from inline format (::)
- 6 from cloze deletions ({...})
- Note: Some cloze questions create multiple cards

**Skipped:**
- H1 "Cell Biology Study Notes" (H1 skipped by default)
- H2 "Notes Section" (has `<!-- flashcard:skip -->` comment)

**Empty card:**
- "What is the nucleus?" (empty answer - card created for manual filling)

**Deck name:**
- "Cell Biology 101" (from frontmatter `deck:` property)
- Alternative: If no frontmatter, would use subtag "biology/cells"
- Fallback: Note title "complete-example"
