# Flashly - Spaced Repetition Flashcards for Obsidian

Flashly is a powerful Obsidian plugin that transforms your notes into flashcards using spaced repetition learning powered by FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler).

## Features

### Multiple Flashcard Formats

Flashly supports four different flashcard formats to match your note-taking style:

#### 1. Q::A Format (Inline)
```markdown
What is the capital of France::Paris
What is 2+2::4
```

#### 2. ?? Format (Multi-line)
```markdown
What is photosynthesis?
??
The process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.
```

#### 3. {Cloze} Format
```markdown
The {mitochondria} is the powerhouse of the cell.
Paris is the capital of {France}.
```

#### 4. Header Format
```markdown
## What is a cell?
The basic structural unit of all living organisms.

## What is the function of mitochondria?
Mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell, responsible for producing ATP.
```

### Smart Deck Organization

- **Automatic deck creation** from note filenames
- **Custom deck names** via frontmatter `deck:` property
- **Subtag-based decks**: `#flashcards/biology` creates a "biology" deck
- **Flexible deck hierarchy** based on your tag structure

### FSRS Algorithm

Flashly uses the modern FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) algorithm for optimal learning efficiency:
- **20% fewer reviews** compared to traditional SM-2
- **Adaptive scheduling** based on your performance
- **SM-2 fallback option** available in settings

### Flashcard Browser

A powerful browser view to manage your flashcards:
- **Deck overview** with statistics
- **Search and filter** by deck, status, or content
- **Study directly** from the browser
- **Track progress** for each deck

### Review Sessions

- **Keyboard shortcuts** for quick reviews (Space, 1-4, Esc)
- **Card flipping animation** for better UX
- **Progress tracking** during sessions
- **Session summaries** with detailed statistics

## Getting Started

### 1. Tag Your Notes

**Important:** Flashly only parses notes that are explicitly tagged for flashcard parsing.

Add the `flashcards` tag to your note's frontmatter:

```yaml
---
tags: [flashcards]
---
```

Without this tag, your note will be ignored during scanning, even if it contains flashcard syntax.

### 2. Create Flashcards

Once your note is tagged, you can use any of the supported flashcard formats:

```markdown
---
tags: [flashcards]
deck: Spanish Vocabulary
---

# Spanish Study Notes

Hola::Hello
Adiós::Goodbye

## What does "gracias" mean?
Thank you
```

### 3. Scan Your Vault

Use the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+P`) and run:
- **"Flashly: Scan vault for flashcards"**

This will find all flashcards in tagged notes and add them to your collection.

### 4. Review Your Cards

Click the flashcard icon in the ribbon or use the command:
- **"Flashly: Open Flashcard Browser"**

Browse your decks and start reviewing!

## Custom Configuration

### Custom Flashcard Tags

You can configure custom tags in **Settings → Flashly → Header-Based Flashcards**.

Default tags: `flashcards`, `cards`

### Custom Deck Names

Control how your flashcards are organized into decks:

**Option 1: Frontmatter deck property**
```yaml
---
tags: [flashcards]
deck: My Custom Deck
---
```

**Option 2: Subtags**
```yaml
---
tags: [flashcards/biology]
---
```
This creates a "biology" deck.

**Option 3: Auto-naming (Default)**
If no custom deck is specified, cards use the note's filename as the deck name.

### Scheduler Settings

Choose between FSRS (default) and SM-2 algorithms in the settings:
- **FSRS**: Modern, adaptive, 20% more efficient
- **SM-2**: Traditional, reliable fallback option

Configure daily limits:
- **Review limit**: Maximum due cards per day
- **New cards limit**: Maximum new cards introduced per day

npm install
```

### Development Build (Watch Mode)
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### Run Tests
```bash
npm test

## Troubleshooting

### My flashcards aren't being found

Make sure your note has the `flashcards` tag in frontmatter:

```yaml
---
tags: [flashcards]
---
```

Without this tag, the note will not be scanned.

### Cards appear from unintended notes

If you're seeing flashcards from notes you didn't intend to parse, check if those notes have the `flashcards` tag. Remove the tag from notes you don't want parsed, then re-scan your vault.

### How do I remove unwanted flashcards?

1. Remove the `flashcards` tag from the note
2. Run **"Scan vault for flashcards"** again
3. The cards from that note will be automatically deleted

### Review session not showing cards

Check your settings:
- Make sure you have cards due for review
- Check if deck filters are limiting which cards appear
- Verify that daily limits haven't been reached

### Traditional Quiz Generation

Generate quizzes automatically from your flashcards using rule-based algorithms:

**Question Types:**
- **Multiple Choice**: Uses other cards from the same deck as plausible distractors
- **Fill-in-the-Blank**: Extracted from cloze deletions `{text}`
- **True/False**: Creates statements to validate understanding

**How to Use:**
1. Run command: **"Generate Quiz"**
2. Configure:
   - Number of questions
   - Question types to include
   - Deck filter (optional)
3. Click **"Generate Quiz"**
4. Take your quiz!
